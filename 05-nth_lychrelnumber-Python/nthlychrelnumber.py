# nthLychrelNumber(n) [20 pts]
# A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a palindrome through the iterative process of
# repeatedly reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. This process is sometimes called the
# 196-algorithm, after the most famous number associated with the process.
# The first few Lychrel numbers are 196, 295, 394, 493, 592, 689, 691, 788, 790, 879, 887â€¦.
